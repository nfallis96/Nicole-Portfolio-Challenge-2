# Personal Portfolio

## Projects Description
 In this project, the purpose was to make a professional portfolio about yourself and add the projects you've done. Furthermore, this website page is meant to show my knowledge of HTML, CSS, flexbox, media queries, and more skills. The intention of this portfolio is for future employers to observe your work.
